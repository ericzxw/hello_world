# hello_world
my first github repository
write something about myself:
-student of busniess informatics
-movie lover
now I am gonna change some other Markdown syntax:
`this is a line of code`

I would like to make a reference of a paragraph using a blockquote:
>Life is a transient journey through the corridors of existence, where the interplay of choice and circumstance molds our individual narratives. We find ourselves in a perpetual quest to unravel the enigmatic tapestry of reality, seeking purpose and meaning in a world that often appears capricious and chaotic.

ok, next it gonna be a link
[this is a link to google search](https//google.com)

Good job, let's continue to learn how to use github.
Wish you a nice journey!
